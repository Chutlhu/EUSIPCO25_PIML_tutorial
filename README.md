## 📌 About

This repository hosts the material for the **EUSIPCO 2025 tutorial on Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) for Audio Processing**.  
The tutorial explores how to embed physical laws (such as the wave and Helmholtz equations) into machine learning models for acoustics and spatial audio.  
It covers **physics-constrained** and **physics-informed** approaches, with examples ranging from sound field reconstruction and HRTF upsampling to active noise control and beamforming.
